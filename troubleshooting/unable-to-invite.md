# Unable to Invite ?

### I Just about to add Jericho Why can't I see my server in the list!

![The page should look like this](../.gitbook/assets/unknown.png)

### Check Your Account - is that correct ?

Many people use alternate accounts for Discord , so check twice whether the account you'r logged into is correct.  


{% hint style="info" %}
You can click the `Not you?` text to log out of the current account.
{% endhint %}

### Do you have the correct permissions to add a bot to your desired server ?

Once you have ensured the account you are logged into is correct and is in the desired server.  
Check for permissions - To add a bot you need `MANAGE SERVER` permissions or you can have `ADMINISTRATOR` which overrides all other permissions. 

> Server owners have all the permission in their server.

{% hint style="info" %}
Quick Tip 🎈  
If you can change the name of your server you have the required permissions.
{% endhint %}
